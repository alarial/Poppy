# Poppy
Game for HackMidwest 2015

The level is procedurally generating as you move around the level with treats randomly spawning. 
If you are unsucessful in catching Poppy. You can focus on gathering treats to increase the chances of 
Poppy coming back to you and returning home. 

The most technically challlenging part for us was to generate tiles around the player as he moved in the world 
while also delelteing tiles you could no longer see. Basically by having a 3x3 platform and the player in the center.
